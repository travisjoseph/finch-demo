5. Launch the application
```
python3 app.py
```
6. Navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser to start connecting to providers.

The app should be running on `localhost:5000`. If it is not, please update the `REDIRECT_URI` in `.env.local` and on the Dashboard accordingly.

## Features
- After connecting a provider, displays company information. 
- Users can navigate to the employee directory which lists out all employees.
- Selecting an employee from the directory will display individual (personal) and employment information.
- If a provider does not support a specific field (`null`or `None`), it will display as *unavailable*.
- If a provider does not support an endpoint, a custom *unsupported for provider* error is displayed.
- Connect scopes are limited to the endpoints required for this demo.
- This app stores tokens in a `.csv` locally. **This is not inteded for production use**. If the `tokens.csv` file does not exist, the app will create one. If multiple providers are connected, the applicaiton will fetch data from the most recent connected provider by default.
